I have put the two CodeWars JavaScript questions in the CodeWars_Question.py file and added the python version of the first question as CodeWars_Question.py. 

The Extra files in addition to the 3 HW questions in homework2.js are from the video lesson I thought was most adjacent to the homework. 

Thank you!
